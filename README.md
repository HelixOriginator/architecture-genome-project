# architecture-genome-project
The Architecture Genome Project models software systems as genetic structures. It encodes architectural decisions into composable “genes,” simulates survival under stress, enables hybrid design through recombination, and maps evolutionary lineages across systems to study adaptability, resilience, and long-term design patterns.
